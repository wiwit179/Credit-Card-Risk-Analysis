# Credit-Card-Risk-Analysis
I will explore in this data analysis the behavior of German borrowers. Questions such as for what purpose do German borrowers apply for credit loans?, How many jobs do each borrower have? , What patterns (if any) determine whether the loan will have a good or bad risk? To make our visualizations more interactive we will be using all our charts with plotly, an interactive library that will allow us to have a better insight about our data.
